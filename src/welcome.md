# Welcome beta tester ðŸ‘‹

You are one of **very few**.

Selected to be a early access user of Slapper.io.

Remember that this is early and the program still have some faults.

But it might also change the world of music.

And you were one of the first.

That's cool.

**This release**

This is v0.1. It is the first version. With this I want to test the general usecases and see if I spark some ideas with you users.

Which usecases could slapper help *you* with?

Which general features are you missing?

<br />
<br />

Use it as much as you want. 

Feedback is very important to me, so please **spam** me with feedback (yes).

<br />

Best,

Lars Karbo
